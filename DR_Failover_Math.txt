Introduction
Q: 
How long will it take for DR Failover to occur?
 
A: 
The calculation for how long it will take for a DR failover to occur is:
Seconds to Failover = (TIMEOUT * CheckRetriesCount) + (CheckRetriesInterval* (CheckRetriesCount-1)) 

 

The TIMEOUT parameter is located in the vault.ini file in the Disaster Recovery installation folder, by default "%program files (x86)%\PrivateArk\PADR".

The CheckInterval, CheckRetriesCount, and CheckRetriesInterval are located in the PADR.ini



See attached image for PADR workflow.

Default values are:

TIMEOUT=30
CheckRetriesCount=5
CheckRetriesInterval=30
