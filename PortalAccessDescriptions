They must be trained because they will be handling the software and working directly with support. The limit and training requirements are for the benefit of our customers because it makes support better able to server your company's needs, it reduces the likelihood of failures because it ensures that the software is being supported by dedicated and trained CyberArk professionals, and it reduces inefficiencies that can be detrimental to the effectiveness of the product.
